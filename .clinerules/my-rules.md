# Rules for Cline 
Don't generate .meta files for new .cs files.

Add comments but don't add them to every single thing - focus on naming properly and writing easy to understand code, and add comments explaining WHY rather than WHAT

Adhere to DRY

Write code with orthogonality considered

Don't use var - use explicit types instead

When in plan mode, please write first a TLDR section that is explicit and to the point. Then you can append additional thoughts and information 

Do not attempt to run tests - this is a Unity project so it's a waste of tie.
